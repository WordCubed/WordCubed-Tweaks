# WordCubed-Tweaks
All the little tweaks I've made while modding Supreme Commander for personal use.
All of these are fairly straightforward edits of existing game files. Where possible, the files copied before editing were taken from Forged Alliance Forever (FAF).
If FAF made no changes itself to a particular unit (and thus had no corresponding files for it), I used the original Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance base game files.
